# 1pass

A 1Password-compatible password management tool for Linux.

Note that this only uses the old version of 1Password's data files, the
["Agile Keychain" format](https://support.1password.com/cs/agile-keychain-design/).

Newer versions of 1Password use the
["OPVault" format](https://support.1password.com/opvault-design/), which
isn't supported here, beyond some initial parsing efforts.

Even if this isn't enough to stop you: work on 1pass basically halted when
an official 1Password GUI client came to Linux. I use it and recommend it myself.

But, if this code is useful to you, have at it; I accept patches.
